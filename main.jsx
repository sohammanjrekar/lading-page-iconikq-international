      passage2:"Hereâ€™s a cohesive passage that captures all the key points from the provided content about DGFT registrations and certifications: The **Importer Exporter Code (IEC)** is a foundational requirement for any entity seeking to engage in international trade. It is essential for accessing various benefits, applying for necessary licenses, and interacting with customs authorities. In addition, the **Status Holder Certificate** recognizes exporters based on their performance, categorizing them into levels such as Star Export House and Super Star Export House. This certificate provides additional advantages, including reduced documentation, priority in customs clearances, and access to special incentive schemes. Another important certification is the **Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) License**, which allows the import of capital goods at zero or reduced duty for the production of goods intended for export. This license facilitates the expansion of production capabilities and enhances competitiveness in the international market. Similarly, **Advance Authorization** permits duty-free import of inputs necessary for manufacturing export products, effectively reducing production costs and improving profitability for exporters.The **Duty Drawback Scheme** further supports exporters by reimbursing customs duties paid on imported goods that are subsequently exported, enhancing their cash flow through partial refunds of expenses. Various **Export Incentives Schemes**, such as the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) and the Services Exports from India Scheme (SEIS), are designed to promote exports by providing financial incentives that encourage competitiveness in global markets.Additionally, the **Single-Window Clearance for Exports** simplifies the documentation and approval processes for exporters, significantly reducing bureaucratic hurdles and accelerating the export process. For products subject to government control, a **Restricted Imports/Exports License** is required to ensure compliance with regulations and avoid penalties. Registration for **Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) Compliance** helps businesses stay informed about the latest regulations, allowing them to avail relevant benefits. Lastly, the **RCMC (Registration-Cum-Membership Certificate)**, issued by Export Promotion Councils for various commodities, grants access to support services and benefits under different schemes. By obtaining these essential registrations and certifications through the DGFT portal, businesses can streamline their international trade operations while enjoying numerous benefits that bolster their competitiveness and financial performance. This proactive approach ultimately creates a favorable environment for growth in global markets.",
